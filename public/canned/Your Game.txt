Well, I forget your number
I don't know how I did it
But I did it and I'd do it again
I forget the car
I know you're losing me
And yes, I walk away with it all
You go and I will stay
If you love then I will hate
Everything, everything, everything about
The far east side of the biggest river
____ says there's no time ____
She says you've got to buy the right clothes
And you've got to shop at the right stores
And singer takes a walk on the front porch
Broken hands, no words, it could have been worse
Takes her place at the back of the line
Said, "Baby, you're much better than fine"
You go and I will stay
And if you love him, I will hate him
Everything, everything, everything about this game
Because nothing, no nothing
Ah-ah-ah-ah nothing, no nothing
Is going to keep me away
I've got cold feet on the front porch
Of the house that you said you couldn't see
Let alone ____
____
____ in the next room, my stomach drops
She says do anything but don't you
You do anything but don't you
You do anything but don't you go
And I will stay
If you love him I will hate
If you go then I will stay
If you love him I will hate
Everything, everything, everything about your game
No nothing, no, no, no nothing
Ah-ah-ah-ah nothing, no, no nothing
It keeps me
You know the answer
You know where I will be
You've got things figured out
Yeah well, figure things out for you and me
You know the answer
You know where I will be
You've got things figured out
Yeah, then figure this out for you and me
Because nothing, no, no nothing
Oh I say nothing, no, no nothing
Keeps me away
