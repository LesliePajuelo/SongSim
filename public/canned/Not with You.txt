I can't believe I've let you in 
And now here I am telling you 
That I'm suffocating in here 
Just like the drugs you are keeping me 
I felt shark teeth underneath my socks 
Before I lost much blood 
Around this world will I be enough? 

From the liquor stores 
To the train stop floors 
Your filthy room, your drama blues 
I am nothing if I'm not with you 
I'm always right, always wrong 
Dressing bad is like loving you 
There is nothing I haven't worn 
Nothing I haven't said before 

Your fluid is thick against my sheets 
When you look at me oh so angry 
I know it's true 
My strength has come from loving you 
Behavior I just can't grow into 
So you fake and you flaw 
For your cops and your cause 
It makes no difference to me 
It's love that you stole, that you stole 

From the liquor stores 
To the train stop floors 
Your filthy room your drama blues 
I am nothing if I'm not with you 
I'm always right always wrong 
Dressing bad is like loving you 
There is nothing I haven't worn 

Nothing I haven't said before 
So here I am around this world 
Will I be enough? 
This is nothing I haven't said before 
You are nothing I haven't felt before
