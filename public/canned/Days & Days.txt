It must be something in the way you move
It must be something in the way you look
I'm not sure just yet

Must be something in the way you dream
You just go home and the thirteen days
In between you and I

This is me before I come undone
This is me before I fall apart
I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days

It must be something in the way you move
Innocent like you gave in
Just like you always would

It must be something in the way they say
And the magic that you bring in between all you imply

This is me before I come undone
This is me before I fall apart
I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days

It could have been a month or
It could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before
Long before you cared
Her art inspired me to
To do my best and
To paint my music like
Like I saw it best
And she says I grew up well
Well, well I grew up strong
Because no one's got my back
No one's going to write me my songs

It could have been a month or
It could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before
Because I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days

It could have been a month or
It could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before
Long before you cared
Her art inspired me to
To do my best and
To paint my music like
Like I saw it best
And she says I grew up well
Well, well I grew up strong
Because no one's got my back
No one's going to write me my songs

It could have been a month or
It could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before
Because I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
I've been tired for days and days and days
