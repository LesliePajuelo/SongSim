Don't bend
Don't blink
Don't beg
Don't scream
Don't whine
Don't fight
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.

Don't feel
Don't tear
Don't kiss
Don't care
Don't touch
Don't want me, don't want me, don't want me.

Somethings so sick about this,
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder

Don't run
Don't hide
Don't hurt
Don't lie
Don't breathe
Don't try
Don't find me, don't find me, don't find me.

Don't cringe
Don't clinch
Don't look
Don't flinch
Don't know, don't go
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me.

Somethings so sick about this,
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder.

Don't sing
Don't talk
Don't yell
Don't laugh
Don't think, don't speak,
Don't save me, don't save me, don't save me

Don't stay
Don't plan
Don't heal
Don't mend
Don't take, don't send
Don't love me, don't love, don't love me

Somethings so sick about this,
My misery is so addictive
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder
I'm halfway there with your Northshore from the floor singing to you over my shoulder
