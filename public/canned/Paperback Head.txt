You have to become what you fancy.
Paperback head, you get carried away.
Stitch up your spine to
Keep the suitors away.

Must draw your own aid.
Must sift your affairs.
Must frame up a material girl.

Wild fires, you must remit.
Can't stand the smoke, pull
The sheets down low,
Rope up your mind, keep
The suitors in line.

Must draw your own aid.
Must sift your affairs.
Must frame up a material girl.
A material girl.

I gasp, like sugar and spice
I gasp, like sugar and spice
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?
Better than you?
Who better than you?

Paperback head, you got carried away.

Must draw your own aid.

A material girl.
A material girl.
