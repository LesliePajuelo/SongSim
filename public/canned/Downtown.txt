If you're gonna get up you might as well get up with me
If you're going downtown I might as well be on your way
And I sit all night
I sit still all night
I won't tell one soul I won't tell one soul
I just can't get it straight you see and oh well
That distraction inside of me oh well
I just can't get it straight you see and oh well
It is fine by you
I am fine by you
I won't tell one soul I won't tell one soul
If you're going downtown take me with you I don't care
If I'm gonna get up I'll just admit it I'll only get up with you
If I'm gonna get up I'll just admit it I'll only get up for you
And I sit all night
I sit still all night
I won't tell one soul I won't tell one soul
If you're going downtown if you're going downtown yeah we can yeah we can
If you're going downtown if you're going downtown yeah we can yeah we can
If you're going downtown if you're going downtown yeah we can yeah we can
If you're going downtown if you're going downtown yeah we can yeah we can
And I sit all night
