I took the train back
Back to where I came from
I took it all alone it's been so long I know
Imagine me there my heart asleep with no air
Begging ocean please, help me drown these memories

All I need to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine

I'm moving east there's somewhere far away from
The sight of my hands the sight of me not moving
You can't just hop a plane and come and visit me again
I claim it's in my head and I regret offering

All I need to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine

You take a second take a second take a year take a year
You took me out and took me in and told me all of this
And then you take a moment take a moment take a year take a year
You help me out I listen in you taught me all of this and then

All I want to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine
All I need to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine you're not mine
