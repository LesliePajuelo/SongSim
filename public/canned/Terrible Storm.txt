There was a terrible storm
And you were wearing all our coats
In the back of this car
I feel like I have traveled nowhere

We buried in the snow
I kept warm inside of your clothes
You swore that nothing would ever change 
The way we were right then

It was a colder a night
Bought a hotel I
I thought you would never 
Find another 

Love again
Oh but you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing

No you haven't missed a thing
There was a terrible storm
And you were wearing all our coats
In the back of this car

I feel like I have traveled nowhere
We buried in the snow
I kept warm inside of your clothes
You swore that nothing would ever change

The way we were right then
It was a colder night
Bought a hotel I
I thought you would never 

Find another
Love again
Oh but you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing

No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
