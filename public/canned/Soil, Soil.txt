Oh and I'm feeling directionless yes
But that's to be expected
And I know that best
And in creeps the morning
And another day's lost
You've just written wondering
And I reply fast

All you need to save me
All you need to save me
Call
And I'll be curled on the floor hiding out from it all
And I won't take any other call

I feel like a fool

So I'm going to stop troubling you
Buried in my yard
A letter to send to you
And if I forget
Or God forbid
Die too soon
Hope that you'll hear me
Know that I wrote to you

All you need to say to me
All you need to say to me
Is call
And I'll be curled on the floor hiding out from it all
And I won't take any other call
