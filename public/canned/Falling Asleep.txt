Falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
I'm falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
I never
If I believe that everything that everything is fine
If I believe that everything that everything is just fine
Well here I am
Beside you and I'm falling
On my knees 
Falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
Will you catch me
Will you catch me
Falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
Falling asleep
Will you catch me
Will you catch me
I'm falling asleep in your arms
Will you catch me
Will you catch me
Falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
If I believe that everything is fine
Just fine
Falling asleep
I'm falling asleep in your arms
Goodnight
