In the dark
Someone came with you and said
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready, are you set?
And so they start again
Don't tell me
Ready, arms out
I am standing here now
Now I'm ready too
Stronger than the rest
Better than the best
She said, "Here I am"
She said, "Here I am"
Strong as any man
The only woman 
She said, "Here I am"
She said, "Here I am"
Stronger than the rest
Better than the best
She said, "Here I am"
She said, "Here I am"
Walk away
You've had more than your say
Ready now, ready now
Let's go, let's ready
Here we go
Better than the best
Stronger than the rest
She said, "Here I am"
She said, "Here I am"
Going to take you 
To the end of tomorrow
I will take you 
To the end of my world
I'm going to fight for the right
To believe in myself
I'm going to fight for the right
To release myself
Release myself and
Rainbow shirt ribbed 
In acid love
And our lives are ribbed
In plastic love
Here I am
Here I am
It's not just you
She loved me too
Here I am
Here I am
It's not just you
She loved me too
Here I am
Here I am
Going to take you 
To the end of tomorrow
I will take you
To the end of my world
I'm going to fight for the right
To believe in myself
I'm going to fight for the right
To release myself
Release myself and
It went on, on, and on
It went on, on, and on
Stronger than the rest
Better than the best
She said, "Here I am"
It went on, on, and on
It went on, on, and on
Strong as any man
Was the only woman 
She said, "Here I am"
Here I am and on
Walk away
You've had more than your say
Here I am
It went on, on, and on
It went on, on, and on
Louder and louder 
It will build and fade
And soon your love 
Will turn to hate
She said, "Here I am"
she said, "Here I am"
It went on, on, and on
It went on, on, and on
Louder and louder 
It will build and fade
And soon your love 
Will turn to hate
She said, "Here I am"
Louder and louder 
It will build and fade
And soon your love 
Will turn to hate
She said, "Here I am
Here I am, here I am"
On, on, and on
On, on, and on
Louder and louder 
It will build and fade
And soon your love 
Will turn to hate
She said, "Here I am"
She said, "Here I am"
Walk away
You've had more than your say
You've fallen down
And now we're tired
And we need some time 
To rest our head
Underqualified, undersatisfied 
I lie
I'm underqualified, I'm undersatisfied
I lie
I'm underqualified, I'm undersatisfied
I lie
I'm going to take you to the end of tomorrow
It's not just you, she loved me too
I'm going to take you to the end of my world
I'm going to qualify
I'm going to satisfy
My love
I will take you to the end of tomorrow
I will take you to the end of my world
