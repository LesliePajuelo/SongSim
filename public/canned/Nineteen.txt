I felt you in my legs
Before I ever met you
And when I lay beside you
For the first time I told you

I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye
I was nineteen, calling me

I felt you in my life before I ever thought to
I need to lay down beside you and tell you
I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye
And now were saying bye, bye, bye

I was nineteen
Calling me
I was nineteen
Calling me

Stayed inside I was so upset
Flew back home to where we met
Cooked up a plan for success
I was all alone you were all I had
You were all I
I was yours right?

I was nineteen
Calling me
I was nineteen
Calling me
