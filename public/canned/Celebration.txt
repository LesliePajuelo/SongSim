That stream the angels like at first
You're a threat and promising no
Between the houses and the stop signs
Your eyes, your future like it all

I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Well, if I ever get home
I'm going to tell you I miss you 
Because I miss you

Where's my
Where's my celebration
I'm breathing with you
When you wake up
You always move closer

By and by and I have never known
Who lied
And I said don't you know
You will live you always anyways
And you voice your fingers when you say
