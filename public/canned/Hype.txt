One time in your life 
You've got the route in hand 
But the map is stuck 
They said it's not your fault 
The tires are tired the camera moves 
And your drivers been pulled 
And I, I have always felt this 
And I, I could never hear it 
So I turned it up and turned it on 
And turned it down 

Always the volume, always the words 
Review the press and tell it like it is 
Your life is hype, your love is hype 
And I, I will clench my own fist 
And I, I will always wait 
There's more, there's more than blood 
That beats through my heart 
My hands, my feet stuck 
Between my tongue and my teeth 

We don't know so we wait for tomorrow 
We don't know so we wait for tomorrow 
We don't know so we only go forward 

Two times in your life you will 
Trace the edge, sink your toes in 
Review the press and tell it like it is 
My life is hype, my love is hype 
And I, I will clench my own fist 
And I, I will always wait 
I'd wait up all night for you
