I can’t say that I’m sorry, getting so ahead of myself
I can’t say that I’m sorry, for loving you and hating myself
I have nothing to show you
I have nothing to hold you down
It’s killing me to walk away

How come you don’t want me now?
Why don’t you wanna wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?
Why don’t you wanna win me now?
Why don’t you wanna show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try, couldn't try and keep me here?

I see you by my house, walking with a different girl
I see you by my house, talking with a different girl
She’s got nothing to show you, she’s got nothing to hold you down
You’re killing me, walk away

How come you don’t want me now?
Why don’t you wanna wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?
Why don’t you wanna win me now?
Why don’t you wanna show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try, couldn't try and keep me here?

One day, soon
I won’t be the one who waits on you (I won't be the one)
So damn soon
I won’t be the one who waits on you

How come you don’t want me now?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?
Why don’t you wanna win me now?
Tell me why you couldn't try, couldn't try and keep me here?

How come you don’t want me now?
Why don’t you wanna wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?
Why don’t you wanna win me now?
Why don’t you wanna show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try, couldn't try and keep me here?

How come you don’t want me now?
Why don’t you wanna wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?
Why don’t you wanna win me now?
Why don’t you wanna show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try, couldn't try and keep me here?
