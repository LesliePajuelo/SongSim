Okay you found me out
Beyond without a doubt
Your lie is safe with me
A friend I'm sure you are
And on this day so far
A fallen hundred see
Hello, it's where I've been
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Hello, it's you and me
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm in the army of
Sell out, shut up, go home
Make some money, baby, when you're dead and gone
When you're dead, when you're dead, when you're dead
When you're dead and gone
Keep this between, between you and me
Just don't whisper nothing's going on
Between this and that
I figure out at last

I wish that more was going on
Hello, it's where I've been
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Hello, it's you and me
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm in the army of
Sell out, shut up, go home
Make some money when you're dead and gone
When you're dead, when you're dead, when you're dead
When you're dead . . . and gone
I'm in the army of
Sell out, shut up, go home
Make some money when you're gone
I'm in the army of
Sell out, shut up, go home
Make some money because I'm bored
She's singing on her own
On her own she sings
She's got a place to sleep
And she invites me in
Nothing more and nothing less
You love them all so leave the rest to me
Oh, so goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Oh me
Yeah, so goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm in the army of
Sell out, shut up, go home
Make some money when you're dead and gone
