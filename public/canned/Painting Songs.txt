Must be something in the way you walk
Must be something in the way you talk
I'm not sure just yet
Must be something in the way you dream
You just go home all the thirteen days in between you and I
This is me before I fall apart
This is me before I come undone
I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days

What's your matter that the fortune don't
All the beauty and I say, "Stop, why won't you be mine?"
Must be something in the way you taste
Lips are magic sauce and I say, "Stop, why won't you be mine?"

This is me before I fall apart
This is me before I come undone
I've been tired for days and days
I've been tired for days and days

Well, it could have been a month or it could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before, long before you cared
Her art inspired me to, to do my best
And to paint my music like, like I saw it best
And she says I grew up well, well
Well, I grew up strong because no one's got my back
No one's going to write me my songs
Could have been a month or it could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before

Because I've been tired for days and days
Oh, I've been tired for days and days and days
Oh, I've been tired for days and days and days
Well, I've been tired for days and days and days

Could have been a month or it could have been a year
But I gave up long before, long before you cared
Her art inspired me to, to do my best 
And to paint my music like, like I saw it best
And she says I grew up well, well
Well, I grew up strong because no one's got my back
No one's going to write me my songs

Could have been a month or it could have been a year
But I, I gave up long before
Because I've been tired for days and days
Well, I've been tired for days and days and days
Well, I've been tired for days and days and days
