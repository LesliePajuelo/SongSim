Here the lights fall just as hard 
A bit softer in the stall 
It's not really wrong 
It's not really right 
I'm wide awake 

She's upfront, upshot 
Upstart up in every case 
The kind of girl that whispers 
Thank god for you 
Oh yeah, all you got/need is me 

Her confusion is in 
The night that I stumbled 
It's in the morning 
That I that I struggled 
Because I start to forget 
But she will always remember 
The kind of girl who laughs and says 
Get up off your knees 
Oh yeah, all you need/want is me 

So you come and so you go 
Tell me how hard how fast 
Baby, tell me how high I must go 
Tell me what you want 
And tell me what you need 
Tell me how hard, how fast, baby, 
How high I must go 
Oh yeah, well all you need is me 
This is the time of my life
