Feel your breath on the back of my neck
Back of my neck
Feel your heart beating outta your chest
Outta your chest
Everyone will say
It's dangerous to take this path
Everyone will tell us
Apart that we are more intact
Everyone will say that we're crazy
And that we won't last
Everyone will tell us
Alone that we are better off

This love ain't made for the faint of heart
When it's love, it's tough
This love ain't made for the faint of heart
Real love is tough

Hear them words in the back of my mind
Back of my mind
Hear them thoughts flooding into our lives
Into our lives
Anyone could say that
We're dangerous to take this chance
Anyone could make us sound like
We don't really have a plan
Anyone could say that
It's chemical and it won't last
Anyone could make
Us seem reckless, tell us we will crash

This love (this love) ain't made for the faint of heart (Ffaint of heart)
When it's love, it's tough
This love (this love) ain't made for the faint of heart (Faint of heart)
Real love is tough

Who cares what anyone says?
(What anyone says about it)
Don't let it into your head
(Into your head)
Who cares what anyone thinks?
(What anyone thinks about it)
Just let me into your heart
(Into your heart)

This love ain't made for the faint of heart
When it's love, it's tough
This love ain't made for the faint of heart
Real love is tough
This love (this love) ain't made for the faint of heart (Faint of heart)
When it's love, it's tough
This love (this love) ain't made for the faint of heart (Faint of heart)
Real love is tough
