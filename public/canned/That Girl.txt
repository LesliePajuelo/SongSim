Sick and tired of things getting tough
Never gonna be enough
Sick and tired of fights starting wars
Never gonna be enough
Say what I want, say what I need
Sick and tired of things getting tough
Say what I want, say what I need
Nobody hurts you like me

When did I become that girl?
That girl I see
When did I become that girl?
That girl I see

Getting fed up with the way you love
Never gonna be enough
Sick and tired of things getting tough
Say what you saw, say what you heard
Sick and tired of things getting tough
Say what you felt, say where it hurts
Nobody treats me like dirt

When did I become that girl?
That girl I see
When did I become that girl?
That girl I see

I never wanna be anyone's enemy
I just wanna let myself be
The girl that I once was
I never wanna be that girl I see
When did I fall so far?
Barely recognise me
When do I move on?
So I recognise me
So I recognise me

When did I become that girl?
That girl I see
When did I become that girl?
That girl I see
When did I become that girl?
That girl I see

I never wanna be anyone's enemy
I just wanna let myself be
The girl that I once was
I never wanna be that girl I see
I never wanna be anyone's enemy
I just wanna let myself be
The girl that I once was
I never wanna be that girl I see
