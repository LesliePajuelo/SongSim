Homemade hugs and blanketed kisses
And then they tell me stories 
Of their, of the fashion issues
And all my hair fell to the floor
Well, that's all right
I can always grow more
One, two, three, four
They line you up
They want you back for more
They said one, two, three, four
Line them up
Tear them down
Then come back for some more
Oh, I'm everything you want in one
I'm everything you need in one
Look to your knees
This is life after me
And all we've got is talk
That's all we've got for now
All we've got is talk
That's all we've got for now
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money
Some money, some money, oh
One, two, three, four
This ain't love at all
I want it all for some more
They said one, two, three, four
Line it up 
Tear it down
Bring it back for some more
Oh, I'm everything you want in one
I'm everything you need in one
Look to your knees
This is life after me
And all we've got is talk
That's all we've got for now
And all we've got is talk
That's all we've got for now
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money
Some money, some money, oh
My head is aching
My soul is shaking
Let it go
My heart is breaking
My hands are shaking
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money, oh
They bought me with some money
Some money, some money, oh
