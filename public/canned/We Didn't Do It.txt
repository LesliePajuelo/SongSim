We didn't do it for the money
I don't know why
We didn't do it for the money
I don't care why
You'll go down down down
Get in my car
Its too full
We didn't do it to be happy
So I can whine
You'll go down down down
On the outside 
Will I grow this out
You think I got my way
We didn't do it for the money
For the last time
You think I got my way
You think I got my way
Get in my car
Get in my car
