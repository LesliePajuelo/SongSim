The sun’s rays don’t bother me 
No, they cast down such a wonderful heat
Masking beauty 
By a terrible fate
If you fly too close and then you turn too late

The night still confuses me
We’d all get tired and have to sleep eventually
Regardless of the sun’s demands
Regardless if it made much sense

You moved so far that I know how far 
And then you got so sad that I, I bought a car
Yes, I’ll come get you 
And I will bring you home
I’ll come get you 
And I will bring you home

He sat me down
He said he was incomplete
He thinks true love’s going to get him back on his feet
He said you only find love once in your life
So I guess when you find it, you got to hold it right
You’ll hold it right

It makes no sense
Because there’s no sense in it at all
We all wait around
We wait for you to get tired and fall
As your shadow, well, it resumes with me
Yes, your shadow, it was made for me

She speaks clearly
He speaks loudly
I speak only clearly loudly
Yes, she speaks clearly
He speaks loudly
I speak only clearly loudly

Yeah, my shadow, well, it resumes with me
Yes, my shadow, well, it was made for me

She told me love will come once in your life
So I guess when you find it
You got to hold it right
You got to hold it right
You hold it right

You moved so far that I knew exactly how far
And then you got so sad that I, I bought a car
Yes, I’ll come get you 
And I will bring you home
I’ll come get you 
And I will bring you home
I’ll come get you 
And I’ll say welcome home
