You wear that superstar status on your shoulder
Don't worry, I won't lean on you when I get cold, yeah
Sell a million copies and I buy back your love
Tell everyone I hate you and I blame the above

Love, you're breaking me
Oh and love, you're shaking me
Yeah, to the curb
To the front door
I'm left empty in between

You wear that chip like it makes up your wardrobe
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're so bad
Sell a million copies and I buy back your love
Tell everyone I hate you and I'll blame the above

Love, you're breaking me
Oh and love, you're shaking me
Yeah, to the curb
To the front door
Well I'm left empty in between

Love, you're breaking me
Oh and love, you're shaking me
Yeah, to the curb
To the front door
Well I'm left empty in between
