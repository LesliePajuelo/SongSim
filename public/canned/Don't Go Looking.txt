Music's kind of like that
Sad and slow
You get all emotional
And I get up to go

Your love sits atop your tree
You shake and shake until it's free
I hope it's good to you
It was good to me

Don't go looking for me there 
I left an hour ago
You had your chance to love me
Now I don't know

Music's kind of like that
Sad and kind of slow
And if you get all emotional
Then I get up and go

Music sits atop your tree
And you shake and shake until its free
I hope it's good to you 
It was good to me

Don't go looking for me there 
I left so long ago
You had your chance to love me 
Now I don't know
