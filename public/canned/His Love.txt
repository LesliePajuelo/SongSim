Augusten, if I write something beautiful
Will it squash the hurt thatâ€™s living deep inside of you?
Augusten, are you just like me
Does your hurt fade as you write out your history?

I just want to know how you were able
To survive so long with the wolf at the table

Augusten, so you were hiding in the forest
With your love still laid out before him
Augusten, with that love stuck inside
How did you ever sleep at night?

I just want to know how you were able
To survive so long with the wolf at the table
Augusten, tell me how were you able
To control the urge to kill the wolf at the table?

His love, his love you spoke of 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Augusten, do you struggle for the words?
Does the right way to put it sometimes hurt?
Augusten, am I just like you?
Could I ever truly know what I would do?

I just want to know how you were able
To survive so long with the wolf at the table
Augusten, tell me how were you able
To control the urge to kill the wolf at the table?

His love, his love, his love
His love, his love, his love
His love, his love you spoke of 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

One, two, three, four
His love right out the door
One, two, three, four
His love right out the door
One, two, three, four
His love right out the door

His love, his love you spoke of 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
His love, his love you spoke of 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
His love, his love you spoke of 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
