I cram it in 
I try my best to scream 
And when I find myself outside your house
I'm trying hard to figure where you're at
Oh, oh, oh
I just need a second

I feel the burn inside my inner thigh
I feel the slightest touch and I might die
And so I figure run and hide
Oh, oh, oh
I just need a second

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Where do you go
When you're not here with me?

And when I cry I do it all alone
And on the floor 
I get myself into the moment
Lose myself completely on it
Oh, oh, oh
I just need a second

I like to think you think about me like 
I like to think about you
Later I'll be thinking of this moment
And I'm waiting
Oh, oh, oh 
I just need a second

And when the spell is cast
I feel myself, I'm falling fast
I get myself into the way
Of the things I want to say to you
Oh, oh, oh
I just need a second

Oh, oh, oh, oh
What do you do
When I'm not there with you?

And when I cry I do it all alone
And on the floor 
I get myself into the moment
Lose myself completely on it
Oh, oh, oh
I just need a second

Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Where do you go 
When you're not here with me?
