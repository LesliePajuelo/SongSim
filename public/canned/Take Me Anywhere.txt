Bright just like the stars above me
Proud just like my mother planned it
Short on all the things I don't want
Full of love and longing
Take me by the hand and tell me
You would take me anywhere
Still, cause I don't want to move a thing,
And all the things I don't want they're full
Of love and longing
Take me by the hand and tell me
You would take me anywhere
And it goes
It's like a come on, come on to me
And it goes
It's like a come on, come on to me
You
You say you don't see any part of me
To love in all this mess 
And I know you take the good 
And all the bad that comes with me
