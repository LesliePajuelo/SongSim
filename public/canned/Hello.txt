Hello Lord, it's me your child 
I have a few things on my mind 
Right now I'm faced with big decisions 
And I'm wondering if you have a minute, 'cause 
Right now I don't hear so well 
And I was wondering if you could speak up 
I know that you tore the veil 
So I could sit with you in person 
And hear what you're saying but 
Right now, I just can't hear you. 
I don't doubt your sovereignty 
I doubt my own ability to 
Hear what you're saying 
And to do the right thing 
And I desperately want to do the right thing 
But right now I don't hear so well 
And I was wondering if you could speak up 
I know that you tore the veil 
So I could sit with you in person 
And hear what you're saying but 
Right now, I just can't hear you. 
And somewhere in the back of my mind 
I think you are telling me to wait 
And though patience has never been mine 
Lord, I will wait to hear from you 
Oh Lord, I'm waiting on you 
Right now I don't hear so well 
And I was wondering if you could speak up 
I know that you tore the veil 
So I could sit with you in person 
And hear what you're saying but 
Right now, I think you're whispering
