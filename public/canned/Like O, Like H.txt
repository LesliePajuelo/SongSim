When I was eight
I was sure I was growing nerves
Like steel in my palm
Make a map of what you see
Direct pain effectively

I was eight
I was sure I was growing pains
Like lead in my feet
SOS to my mother
Take the hinges off the door
SOS to my mother
Take the hinges off the door

Oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Oh

Like O, like H
In your gut
Like O, like H
In your gut
Like O, like H
In your gut
In your
In your

SOS
SOS
Then I was four plus a ten
I was swinging fists

Like nails in a board
Pull your hands inside of you
Six years until I'll be through
I was four plus a ten
I was swinging back

Like a race to be sure
SOS to my mother
Take the hinges off the door
SOS to my mother
Take the hinges off the door
SOS to my mother
Take the hinges off the door

Oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Like oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Like oh, oh sugar spell it out like
Oh

Like O, like H
In your gut
(4x)

SOS
SOS
In your gut
SOS
