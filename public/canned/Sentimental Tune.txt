You
In a simple gray coat
In a simple white room

Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now

You
Hate the tender hearted
Torture song

You
Catch a flame to my sentiment
My sentimental tune

Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now

Hard hearted don't worry I'm ready for a fight
Unnerve the nerve
You're nervous
Nervous that I'm right

Hard hearted don't worry I'm ready for a fight
Unnerve the nerve
You're nervous
Nervous that I'm right

Now
With your cause and affection
On my mind
I won't yield throw caution
Into the blaze

Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now

Watch
With a bit of friction
I'll be under your clothes
With a bit of focus
I'll be under your skin

Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now

Hard hearted don't worry I'm ready for a fight
Hard hearted don't worry I'm ready for a fight
Unnerve the nerve
You're nervous
Nervous that I'm right

Oh
Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now

Oh
Now you know you know it now and so
Now you know you know it now
