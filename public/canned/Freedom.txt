Shoulders of perfection 
Let them drag you 
Straight across and tell me 
Have we found perfection 
Are we finally lost and 
I'm staring from a distance 
Why don't you come get a closer look 
I can guarantee that 
Lickin' the package 
Ain't ever quite as good as 
So they're looking for a new face 
With a voice to go along 
I can tell you right now 
That ain't my style 
I don't do no sing alongs 
With my freedom from 
The mighty sky to the ground 
She said you've got the freedom, baby 
Walk out if they drag you down 

Standin' on the edge of a crisis 
We decide to raise our own voices 
Consider that the sounds is our own 
And the fact our feet grow up from the ground 
This is where I want to be 
This is who I want to be 
So they get my voice 
But they can they can never get my soul 

Yes there's a million things about me 
You will never know 
Like they caught me on video 
And yeah, they caught me on radio, yeah 
They caught me on video radio 
Stereo freedom from 
The mighty sky to the ground 
She said you've got the freedom to walk out 
If you drag me down 
You've got the freedom, baby, to walk out 
If they drag you down 
If they drag you 
If they drag you 
Walk out
