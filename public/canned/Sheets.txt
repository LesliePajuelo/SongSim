Remove us from the scene of the crime
I can't help myself to just fill my mind
They roll their eyes, pull our elbows
I forget our love was so hopeful

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or the stupid sheets

I deserve a stay, a second thought
I put your head on straight, tied my tourniquet
You want the marrying type, a commitment
Can't help myself for feeding off it

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or the stupid sheets

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or the stupid sheets

It's the heart attack that you feel,
It's the heart attack that you feel,
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)

I promise I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
I won't linger long
I promise I won't push my face up against your clothes
Or the stupid sheets

Just give me the key
I watch your things like I watch your face

It's the heart attack that you feel
It's a crying shame not to spend the night
You look your age but you don't act the type
You don't act the type
You don't act the type

It's the heart attack that you feel
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
It's the heart attack that you feel,
(That you feel, that you feel)
