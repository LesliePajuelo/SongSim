Freedom and blood 
I make my mark and fight for tomorrow 
Finally I've got something 
Something I can raise my voice for 
Fine tell them who you really want 
Fine well you'll get yours and I'll get mine 

Proud I'm proud to be proud to see 
They said proud 
I'm proud to be proud to be me 
They said tell me oh you've got to tell me 

Freedom's rough 
So we take our stand and fight for tomorrow 
Finally we got something something we can 
Bring down the house with 
Fine tell them who you think you are 
Fine tell them fine is what you are 

And when you finally figure out what it is you need 
You better think of me 
No no no no 

When I get up 
I feel the rhythm in my fingers 
I get up - I hear the rhythm in my laughter 
Take a second look 
You might find that I am stronger 
Take a second look 
You might find that you are stronger 

Imagination inspiration 
It's only fair that I tell you 
I plan on leaving here tonight with my pride 
It gets me every time with my pride 
I'm proud to be I'm proud to be me
