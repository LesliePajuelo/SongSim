Woke up with beauty in my bed 
And isn't it sad 
How we don't know it's beauty until it's dead
And it's beauty that I knew so well
But she wasn't doin too well
Well 
I just wanna go someplace
Where noone knows my name
And I don't have to explain
No I don't have to retain that I
Lie to myself or protect myself 
For the benefit of myself
I want power in my words
I want passion in my eyes
And when I wake up
I want life to be a surprise
And I guess that I didn't know it all along 
And I guess that I never guessed
That I'd ever guess wrong
Guess wrong
And I set myself up everytime you leave
Everytime you leave
To destroy the things I've got
For the things I need
Each conversation separate from themselves
Separates good from bad
And they never want what you got 
Until it's up for grabs
And then they want what you have
They want what you have
Well I just wanna go someplace
Where noone knows my face
And I don't have to explain
And no, I don't have to retain
That I lie to myself
That I protect myself
For the benefit of myself
I want power in my words
I want passion in my eyes
And when I wake up
I want life to be a surprise
And I guess that I didn't know it all along
And I'll never guess that 
I'd ever go ahead and guess wrong
Guess wrong
And I set myself up everytime you leave
Every time you leave
To deny the things I love 
For the things I need
For the things I need
I want to break through
To break through
Oh I want one thing 
I wanted 
To come through
Oh to come true
I want passion in my eyes
I want power in my words
And when I wake up 
I want life to be a surprise
And I never thought
That I'd wake up
And be starving for you
No I never thought
That I'd wake up and I'd be hungry
I'm hungry for you
To break through to break through
I want one thing I wanted to come through
Ah, to come true
I want power in my words
I want passion in my eyes
And when I wake up
I want life to be a surprise
And I guess that I didn't know it all along
And I'll never guess that 
I'd ever go ahead and guess wrong
Oh I want to break through 
To break through
I want one thing I've dreamed for 
to come true
To come through
Oh I set myself up
Every time you leave
To destroy the things I've got
For the things I need
To destroy the things I love
For the things I've seen
