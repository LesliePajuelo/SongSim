We were so high we thought we'd definitely die
Cause we were dead already, dying
Endless nights took on my whole life
Or so I thought
It turns out all your friends
They were just mean, dressed up
So, come on kids eat those pills
You got your whole life to lose
We've got so many friends
That wear their feet too big for their shoes
We've got cities to visit
We've got trees we've yet to live in
And so get yourself on top of me
Before I'm gone, gone, gone
We were so young
I thought that acting old
Would give me all your love
Give me all you've got
So come on kids eat those pills
You've got your whole life to lose
We've got so many friends
That wear their feet too big for their shoes
We've got cities to visit
We've got trees we've yet to live in
So get yourself on top of me
Before I'm gone, gone, gone
And all night long
On your front lawn
You'd build me a neon village
And you said bring on new diseases
If they're good for you
Then they'll be good for me
Yeah, if it's good for you then it's good for me
If it's good for you then it's good for me
So come on kids eat those pills
You've got your whole life to lose
We've got so many friends
That wear their feet too big for their shoes
We've got cities to visit
We've got trees we've yet to live in
And so get yourself on top of me
Before I'm gone gone gone
And we've got so many friends
That wear their feet too big for their shoes
We've got so many friends
That wear their feet too big for their shoes
