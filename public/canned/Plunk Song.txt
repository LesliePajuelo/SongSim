Granted that I'm so often layered I'm wired
Overcome overdone, my fate is on fire
Eat the sludge and dance to screaming in my head
I'm so happy that we're friends
Me and you

So here I am
Simple and upside down
Corner stone left in the millions
Heavy in my pocket, you look good to me
And my pants are huge and chocolate covered

Hey, I'm just like you
Maybe I'm sloppy and blue
But hey, I'm just like you
Except I've got nothing to prove
But we're headstrong tonight
Beating through the rainbows of right
Gold-covered prisms of light
Make us headstrong tonight

Witchcraft haunt
And I'm slowly crumbling
And moving magic dreams 
And mothers whisper nice
Hell is my shirt and I melted slow above heaven
Wet to the bone, will you dry me off before I freeze?
But here I am
Bum as a drunk and a lovers
I said that I have loved no others
She goes to the shows not to be afraid
But she knows that it will never be the same

Hey, I'm just like you
Maybe I'm sloppy and blue
But hey, I'm just like you
Except I've got nothing to prove
But we're headstrong tonight
Beating through the rainbows of right
Gold-covered prisms of light
Make us headstrong tonight
Headstrong tonight
Beating through the rainbows of right
Gold-covered prisms of light
Make us headstrong tonight

Hey, I'm just like you
Maybe I'm sloppy and blue
But hey, I'm just like you
Except I've got nothing to prove
But we're headstrong tonight
Beating through the rainbows of right
Gold-covered prisms of light
Make us headstrong tonight

Hey, I'm just like you
Maybe I'm sloppy and blue
But hey, I'm just like you
Except I've got nothing to prove
But we're headstrong tonight
Hey, I'm just like you . . .
