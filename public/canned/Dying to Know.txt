Put a little of you into my heart
Took a chance and you tore it apart
I let a little light into the dark
Cast the black out inside of my heart

See your face makes it hard to move on
Hear your voice, can't manage alone
Tell me what you're doing now, where you live
Tell me are you in love, how you been
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know, I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?

You've been on my mind again
I've been crying to all my friends
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I can't tell this to my friends
Can't let go of what's in my head
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know

Did you ever even give me a thought?
Do you ever think about me at all?
There's a white out over you in my mind
Should've never let you into my life

See your face makes it hard to move on
Hear your voice, can't manage alone
Tell me what you're doing now, where you live
Tell me are you in love, how you been
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know, I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?

You've been on my mind again
I've been crying to all my friends
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I can't tell this to my friends
Can't let go of what's in my head
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know

Why'd you let me go?
I'm thinking I was the only one
You knew I loved you
More than I loved anyone
You know you left me
Nothing but a world of hurt
It kills me still
No matter what you might of heard

You've been on my mind again
I've been crying to all my friends
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I can't tell this to my friends
Can't let go of what's in my head
You hit me back, I wanna understand
Hit me back cause you owe me that
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know, I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know
Is the one you ended up with everything you wanted?
I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know
