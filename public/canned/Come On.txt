You've got your lights turned 
So they can see you 
The very best of what 
You've got to offer 
Tell them what your hands were made for 
Tell them who your mouth was made for 

You've got your profits 
And your mathematicians 
The vocal fuel of a generation 
Tell me what my hands were made for 
Tell me who my mouth was made for 

And please don't be mad at me 
You'll get what you ask for 
Come on, come on, come on 
So very close to what you had expected 
It makes it hard to keep my head up level 
Tell me I'm what your hands were made for 
Tell me I'm who your mouth was made for 

And if you come down on me 
Well you'll get what you ask for 
Come on, come on, come on 
I, I want to get myself back 
High I want to get myself back 
All of the things that you promised me 
That you'd be 
Now your hands are tired 
And all of the things that you promised me 
That you'd need 
Now my hands are tired 
Come on, come on, come on
