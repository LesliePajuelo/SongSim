We all got 
Somebody we love
We don’t got a lot of 
Faith in the above
A little sunshine 
Will please and thank you all right
When it’s cold out
When it’s cold outside
Don’t you 
Forget what I need
A little inspiration 
Gets me through where I’ve been
I’ve got
An army escorting me on
So don’t give me one more reason to
I’ve got somebody I love
Trust in you and me
To keep us up above
The dark clouds
That are circling around sunshine
Well, I need you
I need your love
Well, I need you
I need your love
I need your
Don’t you forget what I need
A little inspiration 
Gets me through where I've been
I've got 
An army escorting me on 
Don’t give me one more reason to
We all need
Somebody to love
To give a little and receive
Well, it's not so tough
So show me 
A road of mine that I haven’t seen
And I’ve got mine at home
And it's waiting for me
Well, I need you
I need your love
Well, I need you
I need your love
Well, I need you
I need your love
I need you
I need you
I need your 
And don't you 
Forget what I need 
A little inspiration 
Gets me through where I've been 
And I've got an army escorting me home 
So don't give me one more reason to 
Well, I need you 
I need your love 
I need you 
I need your love 
I need you 
I need you love
I need you
I need you
I need your love
