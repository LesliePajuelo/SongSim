My windows look into your living room
I spend the afternoon on top of you
I wonder what it is
That I did to make you move in

Across away from me
I hope I never figure out
Who broke your heart
And if I do, if I do

I'd spend all night losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
Well I'd spend the night and I'd lose my mind
My windows look into your bathroom

Well I spend the evening watching
You get yourself clean
I wonder why it is
That they left this bathroom so unclean

So unlike me
I hope I never figure out
Who broke your heart
And if I do, if I do

I'd spend all night losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
I'd spend all night losing sleep

I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
If I spend the night then I lose my mind
Well I hope I never figure out who broke your
Heart

And baby if I do
Well I hope I never figure out who broke your
Heart
Baby if I do

Well I'd spend all night losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
If I spend the night then I lose my mind
Spend all night losing sleep

I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
If I spend the night then I lose my mind
Spend all night losing sleep
I'd spend the night and I lose my mind
If I spend the night then I lose my mind
