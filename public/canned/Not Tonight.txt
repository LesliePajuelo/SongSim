Love pull your sore ribs in
I will pull your tangles out
In the back of your car I feel like
I have traveled nowhere
What will bring me home?
What will make me stay, stay?
What will bring me home?
What will make me stay, stay?
Well I don't know
I don't know, ooh
I don't know
I don't know, ooh
Everything in my body says not tonight
Everything in my body says no
Everything in my body says not tonight
Everything in my body says no
What will bring me home?
What will make me stay, stay?
What will bring me home?
What will make me stay, stay?
Well I don't know
I don't know, ooh
I don't know
I don't know, ooh
