My shirt tucked out
And your hands tucked in
When dark things come calling
They want you to hear
Sweet humming underground sleepless and tired
A love type thing
A sure type thing

Keep your ears wide open
For the sound of the door
If they want you, they'll take you
And that is for sure
Sweet humming underground sleepless and sore
A love type thing
A sure type thing
Oh it's a love type thing
A sure type thing
