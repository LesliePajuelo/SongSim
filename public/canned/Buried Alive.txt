She said she’d live her life more wisely
And so I let her wake up beside me
He says he’d give up almost anything
If I let him live his life next to me
I’m not hungry, baby, I am starving
And I’m laughing in the morning
Morning
Morning
I’m the type of girl
When you fall in love
You fall forever
I’m the type of girl 
When you fall in love 
You fall forever
So I count my fingers 
I count my toes
I remember this
And I remember those
I remember every magic moment
Because when I’m gone
You're going to be alone, alone, alone
And all this time
He was hoping for a poet
He stands up right next to me
He starts singing
You forget that girly man
Baby, you come with me
You forget that girly man
Baby, you come with me
So I’m counting backwards
In my bed I start feeling
Like I’m buried alive
I’m buried alive
Right next to me
She said she'd live her life more wisely
So I let her wake up beside me
Yeah
He says, "Baby, I would do anything
Just let me live my life next to you"
But I’m not hungry, babe, I am starving
And I’m laughing in the morning
Morning
Morning
I’m the type of girl
When you fall in love
You fall forever
And so I count my fingers 
I count my toes 
I remember this 
And I remember those
I remember every magic moment
Because when I’m gone
You’re going to be alone, alone, alone
And all this time
He was hoping for a poet
He stands up right next to me
He starts singing
You forget that girly man
Baby, you come with me
Yeah, you forget that girly man
Baby, you come with me 
So I’m counting backwards
In my bed
I start feeling
Like I’m buried alive
I’m buried alive
Right next to me
