Don't panic
My bags are staying unpacked 
And don't worry
I've got nowhere else to be
When the morning comes, will you still be here?
When the morning comes, will I still be here?
And don't cry
There's nothing to worry about
And don't whine
We've all heard about it before
And don't go looking for mistakes in me
I don't think I can take anymore
When the morning comes, will you still be here?
When the morning comes, will I still be here?
When the morning comes, will you still be here?
When the morning comes, will I still be here?
