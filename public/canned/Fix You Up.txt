What do I, what do I, what do I need to do
To see myself in a better mood?
What do you, what do you, what do you need to do
To get yourself in a better mood?

Well there's not a lot for you to give
If you're giving in
And there's not a lot for you to feel
If you're not feeling it
You bring it up, and bring it in
And we'll get you fixed up in no time

And what I wanted most, what I wanted most
What I wanted most, was to get myself figured out
And what I figured out, what I figured out, what I figured out
Was that I need more time to figure you out

This love is all I have to give
Well there's not a lot for you to give
If you're giving in
And there's not a lot for you to feel
If you're not feeling it
You bring it up, and bring it in, and bring it in
And we'll get you fixed up in no
We'll get you fixed up in no time

This love is all I have to give
This love
