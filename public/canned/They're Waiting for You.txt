He'll shop another day in other ways 
Since she's wasted her life away 
And I watch her as she leaves 
It all behind for him 

And I promised myself 
I wouldn't let myself get this far behind 
And I promised myself 
I wouldn't let you run it all this time 

And I watch you as you lose yourself 
In the thoughts of all 
The things you've done 
And if I could get it all out 
All the things I've lost 
All the things I've done bad 

And I promised myself 
I wouldn't let you get that way that time 
And I promised myself 
I wouldn't let you lose yourself this time 

So what are you going to do 
When you wake up tomorrow 
In someone else's bed?
What are you going to do tomorrow 
When you wake up 
In someone else's head?

So have another drink 
It'll make you cool 
It'll make you you 

We don't have fun when 
We're together anymore
Only get together when we're bored 
We don't have fun when 
We're together anymore 
All we get when we're together 
Is more fucking bored 

And I watch my head fall in your hands 
And I wonder 
Where have I been all this time? 
And I watch my thoughts fall in your dreams 
And I wonder 
Where have you been all this time? 
And I 

So have another drink 
I bet it makes you 
Look like a fool
