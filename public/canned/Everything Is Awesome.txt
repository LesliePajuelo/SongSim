Climbed up on the rainbow
Just to see if I'd fall off
I'm a frosted lemon coward
And I don't know how
No, don't know to hold you
Without shaking
No, I'm not aware of how I could possibly love you
Without aching
Yes I give you everything, yes I give you anything
I gave you everything

Got to watch myself I've got to love myself
And take care
And so keep the light on before

Yeah, hop into bed
'Cause, baby, this is the last honest look I'll ever give

I saved up all my sunshine just to see you more clear
I'm a little short on solar but I haven't given in
No, I'm going to hold you anyway
And I'll do it without shaking
Yes, I'll love you always
And I'll do it without aching
Yes, I'd give you anything, yes I'd give you anything
I gave you everything

Got to watch myself I've got to love myself
And take care
And so keep the light on before

Yeah, hop into bed
'Cause, baby, this is the last honest look I'll ever give

I give you everything I give you anything
I gave you everything

Got to watch myself I've got to love myself
And take care, yeah
I gave you, I gave you 
I gave you everything

So got to watch myself I've got to love myself
And take care

This is your last love this is your last love this is your last love
Yeah this is your last love
This is your last love this is your last love
And so keep the light on before ya' hop into bed
'Cause, baby, this is the last honest love I'll ever give
