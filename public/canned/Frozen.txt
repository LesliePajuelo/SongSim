It's not far to go it's not far at all 
It's not far to go you're not far at all 
Pools out back waters so cold 
There's not much said that I don't know 

The difference between frozen hands and feet 
You come right out and you ask me 
Nobody ever asks me 
In the pool out back water to my chest 
Towel lying in the grass 
It looks a lot worse than it seems 
But you know, baby, that's just me 

Baby, there you go 
That's just me, baby 
There you go 
That's just, baby 
There you go that's just me

It's not far to go you're not far at all 
And darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', yeah 
Looking for a laugh 
want to stop back when you're 
Done whining and taking things back 
I'll be there as always 
Feet submerged and probably frozen 
We can only hope that I'll be frozen 
Enough of that as if I care 
As if I need to know like I was there 
But if I was you just call my name, 
Call my name and I'll be there 
If you call my name you know I'll be there 

Baby, you're so far away 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you say 
You couldn't stop the world for a moment 
In the middle of good-bye 
You stop in to say hi 

Is it all right 
Is it all right if I, 
Hi is it all right 
Is it alright if I, 
Hi is it alright 
Is it all right if I, 
Hi is it all right 
Is it all right

Pools out back water so cold 
There's not much said 
Then I don't know the difference 
Between frozen hands and feet 
You come right out and you ask me
It's not far to go 
It's not far at all(repeat x8)
