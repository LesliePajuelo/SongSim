Press to my knees
Give them hope
And new joys
Bend and lean
On me when
You feel that
Strange dream
Fill my bath
With gold night
Air through my lungs
Limping on two legs again

Don't you think that I've been given up?
Don't you think that I've been given up?
Change, I take the blame
I take the blame
I move away

Space in my life
Give me yours
Room to grow
Pull my ears
Back with words
Heartbeats hurt
You have my chest
Full of cold night
Air in my lungs
Limping on two legs again

Don't you think that I've been giving up?
Don't you think that I've been giving up?
Change, I take the blame
I take the blame
I move . . .
