I know you plan out 
Everything that you hope to say
I wish that we didn't
Have to go about things this way
I love the rock and roll, I love the rock and roll

Don't get so up tight
Don't get so up tight

Oh
Go away

Tell me if you love me like you think you want to be loved
Pull on my hand and say please just let's make it this way
I love the rock and roll, I love the rock and roll

Don't get so up tight
Don't get so up tight

Oh
Go away
Go
Go away
