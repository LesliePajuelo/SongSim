Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
Saved, from one more day of misery
Everything I love
Get back for me now
Everyone I love
I need you now

Don't forget a million miles for me
Safe and another day passed by me
Everything I love
Get back for me now
Everyone I love
I need you now

So I conned, I lied
I lied to me too 
So I conned, I lied
I lied to me too 
Hold out for the ones you know will love you

Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

Go to the edge and back
Slow
To make my move, I'm almost there
Everything I say
I say to me first
Everything I do
I do to me first

So what, I lied
I'd lie to me too 
So what, I lied
I'd lie to me too 

Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too
Dark you can't come soon enough for me
