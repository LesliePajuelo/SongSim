What would I do differently
With two kids on my hip?

Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow 

I'm the age you were then
What goes through your mind?
Find some success
And reduce the worry on your babies' minds

Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow 
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Without any guilt

Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Without any guilt

Credit my weak heart and strong mind
To that bad circumstance and the terrible time
Well I've searched for myself . . .
What will I find?

Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow 

We're eggshells and not easy to hold
We uncurl and unwind when we sleep side by side 

Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow
Let them say what they will, because they will anyhow 
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Without any guilt
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
Lay (lay), lay back and light up
