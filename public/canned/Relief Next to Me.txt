I miss you now
I guess like I should have missed you then
My body moves
Like curtains waving in and out of wind, in and out of windows

I can't untangle, I can't untangle
What I feel and what would matter most
I can't get close and I, I can't get close
And now there's just no point, in reaching out for me

In the dark, I'm just no good at giving relief
In the dark, it won't be easy to find relief
And I'm not proud that nothing will seem easy about me
But I promise this
I won't go my whole life telling you I don't need
But I promise this
I won't go my whole life telling you I don't need

I'll tell you now
I guess like I should have told you then
The thunder moves like damn drawers slamming in my frame
Slamming in my framework

I can't untangle, I can't untangle
What I know and what should matter most
I can't get close and I, I can't get close
And now there's just no point, in reaching out for you

In the dark, I'm just no good at giving relief
In the dark, it won't be easy to find relief
And I'm not proud that nothing will seem easy about me

But I promise this
I won't go my whole life telling you I don't need
