Had a bad day, as bad as they come 
Time to get a real job 
You gotta stop having fun 
So I got a real job 
I'm working nine to nine 
I'm making five bucks an hour 
'Til the day I die 

Got a straw inside of me 
And it's filled just fine 
Got a straw inside of me 
With the strongest wine 
I'm one third passion 
I'm two thirds pride 

Said I used to have a life once 
He said I used to like your smile once 
Singing silence to the world 
But the stars kept marching 
He said silence to everyone 
I said I'm still talking 
Have you got some more 
Deep inside of you 
I'll always have more for me 
I take a little more for me, baby 

I got a picture of the way 
The world has summed me up 
If I could have one wish 
I sure wish that 
I had never grown up 
I got a picture of the way 
I looked when I was three 
I came out laughing, screaming, dancing 
I used to be free spirited 
Now I'm just free of sleep 

I got a burning passion in my throat 
I got a burning passion inside me 
I got a job that wastes my time and gift 
I got a life that needs a serious lift 
And all the things I wanted 
Yes all the things I want 
Go on and on and on and on 
On and on and on and on 
Well I go on 

Silence to the world 
But the stars keep marching 
Silence to everyone 
But I kept talking 
Have you got some more 
Deep inside of you 
Yes I'll always have more, more me 
He says all the things I want 
They go so I, I take a little more
