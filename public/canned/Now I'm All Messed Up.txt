Stay
You'll leave me in the morning anyway
My heart
You'll cut it out, you never liked me anyway
Why do you take me down this road
If you don't want to walk with me?
Why do you exit, go it alone
When you could just talk to me?

Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Whose life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Sad
You come back to me always anyway
Leave a mark
You say you never really loved her anyway
Why do I take this lonely road
Nobody here to walk with me
Don't want to start fresh all over again
Why won't you just comfort me?

Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Whose life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Now I'm all messed up
I'm sick inside, wondering where
Where you're leaving your makeup
Now I'm all messed up
Sick inside wondering who
Whose life you're making worthwhile

Go, go, go if you want
I can't stop you
Go if you want
I can't stop you

Go (Please stay)
Go (Please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you (You'll go if you want to)
Go if you want (You'll go if you want to)
I can't stop you

Go (Please stay)
Go (Please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you (You'll go if you want to)
Go if you want (You'll go if you want to)
I can't stop you

Go (Please stay)
Go (Please stay)
Go if you want
I can't stop you (You'll go if you want to)
Go if you want
I can't stop you
