There's a war inside of me
Do I cause new heartbreak to write new broken song
Do I push it down or let it run me 
Right into the ground
I feel like I wouldn't like me 
If I met me
Well I can't stop talking
For fear of listening to unwelcome sound
And you haven't called me in weeks
And honestly it's bringing me down
I feel like I wouldn't like me if I met me
I feel like you wouldn't like me if you met me
And don't you worry, there's still time
There's nothing to live for 
When I'm sleeping alone
And I wash the windows outside 
In hopes that the glare 
Will bring you around
Sunshine is days away
I won't be saved, I know all the words
I can't say that I'll love you forever
I won't say that I'll love you forever
