They aren't desperate for love and affection 
No, they're desperate for you 
And as you sit out there all sly and sure I've won
Does anyone think as true as you do 
I'm quite sure we'll find one another 
In a place better than this A time filled with us 

And we'll send up our shooting stars and comets 
And we'll make our little gestures 
Because we'll make our little comments 

This song is my anthem and it makes up my ideals 
And who I am has benefited from all my cleverly planned meals 
All my cleverly planned meals 

I'm stripped and vital and I see rules that almost fit 
So if I voice my opinion, would you stay and sit?
And as I stand here screaming in despair, oh, I said

Yes this is my life, and yes you should care 
	
This song is my anthem 					
And it makes up my ideals 				
(Close your eyes)
And who I am has 
(Free your mind)
Benefited from all my 	
(You're free to fly)
Cleverly planned meals 
(Just say close your eyes)
All my cleverly planned meals
(Free your mind, you're free to fly)
Hardly happy at all and 				
I'm ready to take the fall 
Because we pay for the stupid things 				
We've done where we come from 
Can you sit through this? 
(Can you sit through this?)
Or is it going to be too deep
(Too deep)

Will you ever use common sense?
It comes pretty cheap 	
So if I speak more clearly
If I make more sense 

Will you just shut your mouth? 
You won't come across so dense 

Close your eyes and then you free your mind 
You're free to fly

This song is my anthem and it makes up my ideals 
And who I am has benefited from 
All my cleverly planned meals 
All my cleverly planned meals
