Don't be so hard on yourself 
You can't get better 'til you get worse
Just send a little smile my way
Don't be so hard on yourself
You can't get better 'til you get worse
Just send a little love my way
Don't think I'll confess
Don't think I'll confess that I
Don't think I'll deny
Don't think I'll deny that I
Every second I spend waiting
Drags me closer to my grave
I'm not alone
I'm just on my own
Why isn't it cold outside la la la la lately
Why isn't it cold outside la la la la lately
Don't think I'll replace
Don't think I'll replace you
Don't think I'll be mad
Tell me why should I be mad at you
And every second I spend waiting
Drags me closer to my grave
I'm not alone
I swear to God I'm just on my own
And why isn't it cold outside la la la la lately
Why isn't it cold outside la la la la lately
Don't be so hard on yourself
You can't get better 'til you get worse
Just send a little smile my way
Don't be so hard on yourself
You can't get better 'til you get worse
Just send a little love my way
