When you think nothing could be further from the truth
When you're sure nothing could be further from the cold hard truth
I kneel to condition all the feelings that I feel
Slow it down
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down
You transfer all your weight and disappear
You kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel

I've got a red belt around my mind

My hands tied around these words
I wish you'd call but I know that you're out tonight
My ears fill with the sound of you kneeling
My ears fill with sound of descent
My ears fill with the sound of you arching
Slow it down
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down
You transfer all your weight and disappear
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
