There is mass confusion in the forest, I heard it on the radio 
And they're bringing in some guy and he is going to go on
About all the things he don't know 
And there's some girl in the background screaming something 
About missing trees and I'm wondering 
Where did they go? 
No lines on the highway, no passing they say 
No green to my left and no green to my right 
And the man behind the axe always gets a full meal 
Because green never puts up much of a fight 
So here's some helpful hints, some breath-assured pints 
Full of beautiful grace so we steal their space 
And death comes quickly so we pull up to our 
Double car garage hideaways and we start to say 
Where did all the trees go? 
They moved across the street to grow 
Where did all the trees go? 
Does anyone know? 
Where did all the lights come from? 
They say you're big before you're small 
I'm sure glad I don't know it all 
If the trees could be lions would they still fall and be tagged 
Would they refuse to surrender, refuse to be gagged? 
If the trees had a mother and a father like mine 
Would they stand up say, "Praise the trees, the trees will be fine" 
Wake me up from this dream and tell me things 
Aren't as bad as they seem 
And tell me, is it so not cool to say, "Who will save the trees? 
Will it be me?"
