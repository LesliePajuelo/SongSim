They aren't desperate for love and affection
They're desperate for you
And as they sit out there all sly and sure
Does anyone feel as they do 
I'm quite sure we'll find one another
In a place better than this A time filled with us
And we'll send up our shooting stars and comets
And we'll make our little gestures 
We'll make our little comments 
This song is my anthem and it makes up my ideals
And who I am has benefited from my cleverly planned meals 
I'm stripped and vital and I see rules that almost fit
And if I voice my opinion, will you stay and sit? 
And as I stand here screaming in despair 
I say, "Yes this is my life and yes you should care"
This song is my anthem and it makes up my ideals 
And who I am has benefited from my cleverly planned meals 
Hardly happy at all and I'm ready to take the fall
We pay for the stupid things we've done where I come from 
Can you sit through this or is it too deep? 
Will you ever use common sense, it comes pretty cheap 
And if I speak more clearly, if I make more sense 
Will you shut your mouth, you won't come across so dense 
Close your eyes and then you free your mind 
You're free to fly
