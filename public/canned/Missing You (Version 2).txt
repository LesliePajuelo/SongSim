Threw out believable yesterday.
I delayed a stutter that was slowly,
Calming me, coaxing me.
You're my daydream.
Does it make you homesick for me?
You're my daydream.
Does it make you homesick for me?
I'm still missing you.
I'm still missing you.
Well I guess that I have
I guess that I have never really had you.
Threw out believable yesterday.
I delayed a stutter that was slowly,
Calming me, coaxing me
You're my daydream.
Does make you homesick for me?
You're my daydream.
Does it make you homesick for me?
And I'm still missing you, missing you, missing you
Well I'm missing you, missing you, missing you
Well I'm missing you, do you miss me now?
Well I'm missing you, do you miss me now?
I rise up, wise up, say it loud.
Soul, I will not lie to you.
Rise up, wise up, say it loud.
Soul, I will not lie to you.
I'm all alone.
I'm still missing you, missing you, missing you.
Yeah I'm missing you, missing you.
Well I'm missing you, do you miss me now?
And I'm still missing you, missing you, missing you.
Yeah I'm missing you, missing you.
Well I'm missing you, do you miss me now?
Rise up, wise up, say it loud
Soul, I will not lie to you
Rise up, wise up, say it loud
Soul, I will not lie to you
I will not, cause I am all alone.
I will not.
