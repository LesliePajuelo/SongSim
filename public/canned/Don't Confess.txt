Don't think I'll confess
Why would I confess that I?
Don't think I'll deny
Why would I deny that I?

And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah, you send a little smile my way

Don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah, you send a little love my way

And every second I spend waiting
Drags me closer to this grave
I'm not alone, no, I'm just on my own
And I, it's a little cold outside
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And don't think I'll escape
Why would I escape you?
And don't think I'll replace
How could I replace you?

And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah, you send a little smile my way

And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah, you send a little love my way

And every second I spend waiting
Drags me closer to this grave
I'm not alone, no, I'm just on my own
And I, it's a little cold outside
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And so don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Send your love my way
