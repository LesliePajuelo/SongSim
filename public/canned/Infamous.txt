West Coast has got me screaming 
They’ve got me by the collar
If you want it
You come get it
You tell the East Coast not to bother
If you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You've got to give it all
Oh, give it all to me
A pop princess, my own diva
Go on, go on, go on and see her
Tell her she’s out of luck
She’s out of touch
And we all know that she’s been around the block
For days and days
Oh, for days and days
If you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
Oh, give it all to me
I'm infamous for being infamous
I don’t think you’re so famous, miss
I miss everything
When you’re away from me
Infamous for being infamous
Well, I don’t think you’re so famous, miss
I miss everything 
When you’re away from me
So if you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you need me
Well baby, come and see me
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
If you’ve got it to give
You’ve got to give it all
Oh, give it all to me
