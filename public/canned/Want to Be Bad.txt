Your crowbar swung
Through the, the restaurant
More like a pub
Yeah we, we drank a lot

Don't get in
Over your head
I just want to be bad
Oh oh alright

I just want to be bad
Oh oh alright
You're so tragedy
And you were hard on me

You're so tragedy
And you were hard on me
You might be dead
But it's hard to know

The night turns in
But you all go
Don't get in
Over your head

I just want to be bad
Oh oh alright
I just want to be bad
Oh oh alright

You're so tragedy
And you were hard on me
You're so tragedy
And you were hard on me

Then morning came
(Then morning came)
We're in this together
And then morning came

(Then morning came)
We're in this together
I don't care how far we go
What's the matter?

What's the matter?
I just want to be bad
Oh oh alright
I just want to be bad

Oh oh alright
You're so tragedy
And you were hard on me
You're so tragedy

And you were hard on me
