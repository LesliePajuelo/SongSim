One month to the day
That you said that you’d never change
And if I am right 
Then you were always wrong
You got a hand in this?
Old man behind his walls
And all day long he's fielding calls
Says this whole world is going to shut down without me
Well, let’s see 
And show your hands to me
And show your hands to 
Sinking into your queen-sized kingdom
I’m begging you to stay, stay, stay
And sinking into your queen-sized kingdom 
I’m begging you to go, go, go
And take your pride 
No room here for you anymore
Take your pride 
No room here for you anymore
If you go, how do I know that
If you go, how do I know that
If you go, how do I know that
You’ll be back again?
Because in the end you always
Come for me
One month to the day 
That you said that you’d never change
And if I am right
Then you were always wrong
You got a hand in this?
An old man behind his walls
And all day long he's fielding calls
Said this whole world is going to shut down without me
Well, let’s see
And show your hands to 
Sinking into your queen-sized kingdom
I’m begging you to stay, stay, stay
And sinking into your queen-sized kingdom 
I’m begging you baby go, go, go
And take your pride
No room here for you anymore
Take your pride
No room here for you anymore 
If you go, how do I know that
If you go, how do I know that
If you go, how do I know that
You’ll be back again?
Because in the end you always 
You come for me
