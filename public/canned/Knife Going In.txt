If I don't recover
Sell this house and find
Something lost outside your window
Not forever
But on the night I die
I swear I'll sleep outside your window

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling anxious
Not enough to kill me
I thought it'd happen fast
But I'm feeling it now 
And I feel anxious
Sleeping inches from me
I let it pass

Emy should I stop?
Do you think I'll make
It to the morning if it's written
Stitch it up
The kind of song I know 
Causes mother, sister, lover worry

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling anxious
Not enough to kill me
I thought it'd happen fast
But I'm feeling it now
And I feel anxious
Sleeping inches from me
I let it pass
