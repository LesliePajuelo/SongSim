I don't need company
In the company of you
And I don't need love
Because your love will do

And I've got you
And you've got me
And that's all we need

I don't need air
I don't need to breathe
And I don't need rest
I don't have time to sleep

Because I've got you
And you've got me
And that's all we need

When I get up, so do you
When you get home
I sleep right through
And on the road
I sleep alone
And I can't wait
Until I'm home

Because I've got you
And you've got me
Yeah, I've got you
And you've got me
And that's all we need
