I cried so hard that you pushed me further away
I screamed so loud you called the police on me
I got so city girl on you
I get so sad 
That sad gets to be
So scared that all my feelings 
They up and leave me
I got so city girl on you
I go so crazy I
Don't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I look so long
I get obvious
I look so hard
I look obvious
I work so much
I miss the sun shine away
I sleep so little
Watch the stars fade into day
I get so city girl on you
I go so crazy I
Don't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I get uncertain 
Promise I'll be perfect from now on
But all my promises
They're out the window once you're gone
You pack your bags
You say I love you but I cannot stay
So I started smoking
Thought the signals
Would scare your wolves away
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I cry so hard that you push me
Further away
I scream so loud you call the
Police on me
You pack your bags
You say I love you but I cannot stay
So I started smoking
Thought the signals
Would scare your wolves away
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
Ooh
