Those windows, these eyes
Don’t worry, I won’t cry
And if you go, should I stay?
And if I lie, which way?

If I love again and end up just the same
If I move away, will you give chase?
Will you give chase?

Those windows, these eyes
Don’t worry, I won’t cry
And if you go, should I stay?
And if I lie, which way?
Which way?

If I love again and end up just the same
If I move away, will you give chase?
If I love again and end up just the same
If I move away, will you give chase?
Will you give chase?

Will you
Will you
Will you
Will you
Will you
Will you
Will you
Will you
Give chase
