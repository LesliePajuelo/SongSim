On a dark plane thoughts of crashing come to me 
And my therapist says this is all right with her
Then it's all right with me
On a cold afternoon thoughts of crashing come to you
And the animals take a vote 
And they decide to take me home
Because I've got no more stories
I guess I'm funny no longer
I've got a whole new me picked out
You left me to wonder
If I burned up all my stuff and I've got to move
Go out and find things that I like better
But if I come home with all the same old stuff 
And you leave me to wonder
So make your move
Got to take your time
Got you've got all the time in the world
Got got my love back
You're insane
I've got that
I want my love back
You're insane
I've got no more stories 
I guess I'm funny no longer
You've got a whole new me picked out
You left me to wonder
Left me to wonder
Maybe this is because I'm too tall
And when I think you can't see my thoughts
Well see with your heart
Not with your head
See with your heart
Not with your
If it's so funny let's see what you've got 
And I, I think you're so messed up
And I, you're my stomach making trouble again
Who cares if you're right
I just want to win
I've got no more stories
Because I'm funny no longer
You had a whole new picked out
You have a whole new me picked out
You left me to wonder
