Talked myself into being blue
It seemed easier than 
Finding something new
And I broke them down
Did it all for you
No need, no need for thank-yous
Go ahead and change
Go ahead and change
Go ahead and change
Talked myself into being strange
And take your very breath away
And I asked myself why love won't change
So I could take your very breath away
Someone pray the waters will meet
And for you I will do the same
No one's very real today
No one's very real today
All I have to give this world is me
And that's it
And all I have to show this world is me
And that's it
And all I have to face this world is me
And that's it
Just me, just me, just me and that's it
Faced ourselves in the mirror last night
To learn who we are 
So when we know we're right
It's a big competition to get to the top
Common sense put us up
Encouraging us not to stop
Until you get to the top
Don't stop until the top
And someone say
Don't you ever want to change
Don't you ever want to change
Don't you ever want to change
Don't you ever want to change
All I have to give this world is me
And that's it
And all I have to show the world is me
And that's it
And all I have to face this world is me
And that's it
Just me, just me, just me, just me
Just me, just me, just me, just me
Just me, just me, and that's it
And all I have to give this world is me
And that's it
And all I have to show the world is me
And that's it
And all I have to face this world is me
And that's it
And to the rest to avoid the mess
I won't stray, no not me and
All I have to give the world is me
And that's it
And all I have to show the world is me
And that's it
And all I have to face the world is me
And that's it
To the rest to avoid the mess
I won't stray, no not me, not me
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me
Just me, just me, just me, and that's it
