No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

[Chorus]
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

[Chorus]
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist
I was walking with a ghost
I said please, please don't insist

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter which way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

[Outro]
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
Out of my mind(I say please), out of my mind
Out of my mind(I say please), out of my mind
Your out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
I was walking with a ghost
