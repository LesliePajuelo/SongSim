We yell, "Speak up!"
I fill these pages like
I fill those spaces with my lies

We yell, "Step down"
A crowd's not worth this
And love's not worthless
You've got to step up, stranger

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

We yell, "right on"
A class act president
You are my boss
I am competent in your eyes

They yell, "Move up!"
Don't stand back here and wait
Like an animal at a farmer's gate
Am I food or am I free?

So speak up
This is your last chance, my friend
Roll the windows down and take me in

Reach out
Say what you're really about
Are you coming here or not?
Are you coming out?

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

I don't want to know that you don't want me
I don't want to know what you do without me
I don't want to know what I'll be without you
I don't want to know, I don't want to know

I don't want to know that you don't want me
I don't want to know what you do without me
I don't want to know what I'll be without you
I don't want to know, I don't want to know

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday

Might paint something I might want to hang here someday
Might write something I want to say to you someday
Might do something I'd be proud of someday
Mark my words, I might be something someday
