Oh, my wrists are weak 
But if I could lift your body 
Out of a crash of the waves
Out of bed or onto me
Working too hard gets me acting like a letter
So, before you tell me you're not worth the worry  
Hurry

Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Make me go without a word 
Get so crazy when you shut up
Wake up in a panic
Room is dark; you know this body 
Could be this way with almost just any body 
So put me next to the window
Put me next to the light

Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
(Hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry, hurry)
Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
(Hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry)

Oh, my ego's weak
So thought if I could lift your body 
And wake up out of air
The night's too short
You're onto me
Why am I always acting timid and too careful? 
Please, before I tell you I'm not worth the worry 
Hurry

Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Oh, my wrists are weak
I carry weight like a shadow 
So put me next to the window
Put me next to the light
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I like to hurry when I'm wanting you
Hurry, hurry, hurry

Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
(Hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry, hurry)

Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
(Hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry)
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry)

Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry)
Don't judge a book by the size of its wrists
Are you undecided?
(Hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, hurry
