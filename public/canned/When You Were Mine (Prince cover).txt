Maybe you got soft
Flew out the door on the breeze
Maybe you just got lost
On the way back home.
On the way back home to me.
Maybe we're just pretending
And maybe I don't mind
So, now that it's ending
I don't wanna know
Was it all a waste of time?
It's the end of the world
It's the last taste of wine
When you were,
When you were,
When you were mine,
You were lost.
I was blind and we swore it was time
When you were,
When you were,
When you were
My waste of time.
Waste of time
So, I wrote one more story
I just don't know how it ends
About all the boys you're seeing
The ones that you
That you call your friends.
This nightmare keeps repeating
We'll never get to the end
Of this fire we're feeding
The hottest love has the coldest end.
From the start of it all to the end of the line
When you were,
When you were,
When you were mine,
You were lost.
I was blind and we swore it was time
When you were
When you were
When you were
My waste of time.
Waste of time
Waste of time,
Waste of time
Waste of time.
From the start of it all to the end of the line
When you were,
When you were
When you were mine,
You were lost.
I was blind and we swore it was time
When you were,
When you were,
When you were
My waste of time.
Waste of time,
Waste of time,
Waste of time,
Waste of time.
