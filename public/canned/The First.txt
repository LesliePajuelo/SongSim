Stand up sit down baby
Gonna be a formal dress down hey day
We decide why not go downtown
How about you and me we go get wasted

You'll have, you'll have to excuse me
Please please, please excuse me
You'll have, you'll have to excuse me
This will be my first time

By definition from grade school to English 30
We quietly become strong so early
Take it or leave it
They can't believe it

They go from kindergarten to killing sprees
They go from heartache to inner peace
100 foot ceilings 100 percent deceit
He said let's leave this between you and me

My cats watch my stuff leave my house
Between you and me the cat burglars are
What did you see what did you steal
Tell me baby how does it feel

Yeah how do you feel
It's a top ten list of 
Things that move me the most
It's a top ten list of 

Things that bother me the most
A top ten list of 
Things that scare me the most
I'd have to say that the future

Wasting time in the fast food line
I decide to walk the fine line
And celebrate life celebrate death 
I choose to celebrate the first

I celebrate the first
We decide to go out walking
The whole time that we're talking
Convinced that we're living

The whole time that we're dying
We decide to go out walking
The whole time that you're talking
Convinced that you're living

Whole time that I'm dying
Keeps me on my toes 
Where did the time go
You keep me on my toes 

Where did the time go
On the edge of town where the gravel's thin 
They're gonna wear you down
Until you're thin and tired tired tired

Of wasting time in the fast food line
I decide to walk the fine line 
And celebrate life celebrate death 
I choose to celebrate

The first to come the first to go 
The first to say yes the first to say no
I'm gonna seize this moment
The first to come the first to go 

The first to say yes the first to say no
We decide to go out walking
The whole time that we're talking
Convinced that we're living

Whole time that we're dying
Keeps me on my toes
Where did the time go, yeah
Keeps me on my toes

Where did the time go
You keep me on my toes
Where did the time go
You keep me on my toes

You keep me on my toes
You keep me on my toes
