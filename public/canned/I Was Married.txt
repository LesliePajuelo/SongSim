I married in the sun (tell me where tell me where)
Against the stone of buildings built before
You and I were born (start again start again)
To my heart confusion rose against
The muscles fought so long (fought so long)

To control against the pull of one
Magnet to another magnet to another
Magnet

Now we look up in (tell me who tell me who)

To the hours of bodies breaking past
They seem so very tough (it's a lie it's a lie)
They seem so very scared of us
I look into the mirror (look into)
For evil that just does not exist
I don't see what they see (tell them that tell them that)

Try to control the pull of one
Magnet to another magnet to another
Magnet to another magnet to another
