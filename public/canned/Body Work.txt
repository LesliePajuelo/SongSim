I still wanna see you tonight
Will you be around?
I still wanna get you alone
Will you be around? (be around, be around)
Can I take all the steps that I’m planning tonight
Without risking it all?
Can I make all the moves I’m making tonight
Without hurting you bad

You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel your body doin' overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel my pulse doin' overtime

I won’t give you what‘s right
You still come around
I won’t put up a fight
You still come around (Come around, come around)

Can I take all the steps I’m planning tonight
Without risking it all
I get shy
Can I make all the moves I’m makin’ tonight
Without hurting you bad
I get shy

You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel your body doin' overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel my pulse doin' overtime

You gotta fine form
Nobody’s sayin' no
Walkin' a fine line
Without hurting you bad

Can I take all the step I’m plannin’ tonight
Without risking it all?
I get shy
Can I make all the moves I’m making’ tonight
Without hurting you bad

[Repeat: x2]
You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
You do your body work
I feel my pulse working overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel your body doin' overtime
I get shy in these lights 
I feel my pulse doin' overtime
